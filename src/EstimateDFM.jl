"""
    estimate a dynamic factor model.
    parameters:
        Y : DataFrame | Array{Number, 2}
            matrix of variables, size (n_obs, n_variables). Must include a column of type Dates.Date.
        blocks : DataFrame, size (n_variables, n_blocks). Note don't include date column in n_variables
            matrix of 1s or 0s for block loadings, i.e. included in block.
            ex for Y 2 x 3, 2 blocks:
                [1, 0]
                [1, 1]
                [0, 1]
        p : Int
            number of lags in transition equation
        max_iter : Int
            number of iterations for EM
        threshold : Float
            EM loop threshold
    returns: Dict
      :X_smooth => Kalman-smoothed data where missing values are replaced by their expectation
      :Z => smoothed states, rows give time, and columns are organized according to matrix C
      :C => measurement matrix, rows correspond to each series, and the columns are organized as
        - columns 1-20 give the factor loadings. For example, 1-5 give loadings for the first
        and are organized in reverse-chronological order (f^G_t, f^G_t-1, f^G_t-2, f^G_t-3, f^G_t-4)
        - Columns 6-10, 11-15, and 16-20 give loadings for the second, third, and fourth blocks respectively.
      :R => covariance for measurement matrix residuals
      :A => transition matrix, a square matrix that follows the same organization scheme as matrix C's columns.
        Identity matrices are used to account for matching terms on the left and righthand side.
        For example, we place an I4 matrix to account for matching (f_t-1; f_t-2; f_t-3; f_t-4) terms
      :Q => covariance for transition equation residuals
      :means =>  series mean
      :sdevs => series standard deviation
      :Z0 => initial value of state
      :V0 => initial value of covariance matrix
      :p => number of lags in transition equation
      :num_iter => number of iterations required for convergence
      :convergence => bool if algorithm converged successfully (given max_iter)
      :loglik => log likelihood of last iteration
      :LL => sequence of log likelihoods per iteration
